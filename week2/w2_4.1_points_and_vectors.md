# POINTS AND VECTORS  (30 points possible)
The given prelude defines three types, one for three dimensional points, another for velocity vectors in three dimensions, and another one representing moving objects in space.

1. Write a function `move : point -> dpoint -> point` such that `move p dp` is the point `p` whose coordinates have been updated according to `dp`.
(`x` is now `x +. dx`, `y` is now `y +. dy`, `z` is now `z +. dz`).

2. Write a function `next : physical_object -> physical_object` such that `next o` is the physical object `o` at time `t + dt`.
The position of `next o` is the position of o moved according to its velocity vector.
Suppose that these objects are spheres whose radius is `1.0`.

3. Write a function `will_collide_soon : physical_object -> physical_object -> bool` that tells if at the next instant, the two spheres will intersect.

### THE GIVEN PRELUDE
```ocaml
type point  = { x : float; y : float; z : float }
type dpoint = { dx : float; dy : float; dz : float }
type physical_object = { position : point; velocity : dpoint }
```

### YOUR OCAML ENVIRONMENT
```ocaml
let move p dp =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let next obj =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let will_collide_soon p1 p2 =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;
```
