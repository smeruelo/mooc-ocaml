# ENIGMA  (30 points possible)
Let us solve the following puzzle:
If you multiply my grand-son age by four, you know how old I am. Now, if you exchange the two digits of our ages then you have to multiply by three my age to get the age of my grand-son!

1. Write a function `exchange` of type `int -> int` that takes an integer `x` between 10 and 99 and returns an integer which is `x` whose digits have been exchanged. For instance, `exchange 73 = 37`.

2. Define `is_valid_answer` of type `int * int -> bool` such that `is_valid_answer (grand_father_age, grand_son_age)` returns `true` if and only if `grand_father_age` and `grand_son_age` verify the constraints of the puzzle.

3. Write a function `find : (int * int) -> (int * int)` that takes a pair `(max_grand_father_age, min_grand_son_age)` and returns a solution `(grand_father_age, grand_son_age)` to the problem, where `min_grand_son_age <= grand_son_age < grand_father_age <= max_grand_father_age` or `(-1, -1)` if there was no valid answer in the given range.

### YOUR OCAML ENVIRONMENT
```ocaml
let exchange k =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let is_valid_answer (grand_father_age, grand_son_age) =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let find answer =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;
```
