# TIME ON PLANET SHADOKUS  (30 points possible)
On planet Shadokus, a year has 5 months, each month has 4 days, each day has 3 hours and each hour has 2 minutes. A calendar date is therefore defined as the record type `date` of the given prelude.

1. A date is well-formed if its year index is `>= 1`, its month index is `>= 1` and `<= 5`, its day index is `>= 1` and `<= 4`, its hour index is `>= 0` and `<= 2`, and its minute index is `>= 0` and `<= 1`.
The start of year `12` would be:
```ocaml
{ year = 12; month = 1; day = 1; hour = 0; minute = 0 }
```
The end of year `12` would be:
```ocaml
{ year = 12; month = 5; day = 4; hour = 2; minute = 1 }
```

Write a function `wellformed : date -> bool` which checks that the input date is well formed.

2. On planet Shadokus, the origin of time is the discovery of the Big-Lambda-Machine, a magical computer that evaluates the infinite lambda-term of time. It is defined by value `the_origin_of_time` of the given prelude.
Write a function `next : date -> date` which computes the date which comes one minute after the input date.

3. In this computer, the time is represented by an integer that counts the number of minutes since `1/1/1 0:0` (the origin of time).
Write a function `of_int : int -> date` that converts such an integer into a `date`.

### THE GIVEN PRELUDE
```ocaml
type date =
  { year : int; month : int; day : int;
    hour : int; minute : int }

let the_origin_of_time =
  { year = 1; month = 1; day = 1;
    hour = 0; minute = 0 }
```

### YOUR OCAML ENVIRONMENT
```ocaml
let wellformed date =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let next date =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let of_int minutes =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;
```
