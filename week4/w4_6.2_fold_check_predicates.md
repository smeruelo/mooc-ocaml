# USING FOLD TO CHECK PREDICATES  (75 points possible)
1. Using `List.fold_left`, write a function `for_all : ('a -> bool) -> 'a list -> bool`. It takes as argument a list `l` of type `'a list`, and a predicate `p` of type `'a -> bool`. It must return `true` if and only if all elements of `l` satisfy the predicate `p`.
2. Using `List.fold_left`, write a function `exists : ('a -> bool) -> 'a list -> bool`. It takes as argument a list `l` of type `'a list`, and a predicate `p` of type `'a -> bool`. It must returns `true` if at least one element of `l` satisfies the predicate `p`.
3. Write a function `sorted : ('a -> 'a -> int) -> 'a list -> bool`, using `List.fold_left` that checks that a list of elements `l` of type `'a` is sorted, according to an ordering function `cmp` of type `'a -> 'a -> int`.
The ordering function returns:
* `1` (or any positive number) if the first element is greater than the second,
* `-1` (or any negative number) if the first element is lesser than the second,
* and `0` otherwise.

For the `fold_left` part, you can use the type `'a option` as the accumulator: at each iteration of `fold_left`, if the list if sorted until now, the acccumulator is either `Some v`, where `v` is the previous element, or `None` otherwise.
Remember, the empty list is sorted, so you can use the list with at least one element to check using `fold_left`.

# YOUR OCAML ENVIRONMENT
```
let for_all p l =
  "Replace this string with your implementation."

let exists p l =
  "Replace this string with your implementation."

let sorted cmp l =
  "Replace this stirng with your implementation."
```
