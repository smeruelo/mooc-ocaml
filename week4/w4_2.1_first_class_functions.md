# USING FIRST CLASS FUNCTIONS  (20 points possible)

1. Write a function `compose : ('a -> 'a) list -> ('a -> 'a)` that takes as argument a list `l` of functions, and that returns the function that is the composition of the functions in `l`. For instance, `compose [f;g;h] x = f (g (h x))`. Or with concrete functions, `compose [(fun x -> x+1);(fun x -> 3*x);(fun x -> x-1)] 2 = 4`.

2. Write a function `fixedpoint : (float -> float) -> float -> float -> float` that takes a function `f` of type `float -> float` and two floating-point arguments `start` and `delta`. The function `fixedpoint` applies repetitively `f` to the result of its previous application, starting from `start`, until it reaches a value `y` where the difference between `y` and `(f y)` is smaller than `delta`. In that case it returns the value of `y`. For instance, `fixedpoint cos 0. 0.001` yields approximately `0.739` ([ref](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DottieNumber.html)).

### THE GIVEN PRELUDE
```ocaml
type int_ff = int -> int
```

### YOUR OCAML ENVIRONMENT
```ocaml
let rec compose = function _ ->
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let rec fixedpoint f start delta =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;
```
