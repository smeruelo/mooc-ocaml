# USING AND WRITING THE MAP FUNCTION  (30 points possible)
The idea of this exercise is to use the principle of the `map` function to implement algorithms that transform data structures using higher-order functions.

1. Using the function `map` from the module `List`, write a function `wrap : 'a list -> 'a list list` that transforms a `list` of elements `'a` into a list of singleton lists.
For instance, `wrap [1;2;3]` is equal to `[[1];[2];[3]]`
2. Consider the definition of the type `tree` given in the prelude. It represents binary trees carrying data items, on its internal nodes, and on its leaves.
Write a function `tree_map : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a tree -> 'b tree` such that `tree_map f t` yields a tree of the same structure as `t`, but with all its data values `x` replaced by `f x`.
For example, suppose a function `string_of_int : int -> string`, that takes an integer and generates the string that represent this integer. Applied to `tree_map` and a tree of integers (i.e. of type `int tree`), it would yield a tree of strings (i.e. of type `string tree`).

### THE GIVEN PRELUDE
```ocaml
type 'a tree =
    Node of 'a tree * 'a * 'a tree
  | Leaf of 'a;;
```

### YOUR OCAML ENVIRONMENT
```ocaml
let wrap l =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let rec tree_map f = function _ ->
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;
```
