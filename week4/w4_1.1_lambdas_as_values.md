# LAMBDA-EXPRESSIONS AS VALUES  (20 points possible)
In this exercise, we will define functions as values, also called lambda expressions, using the keyword `function` to do a pattern-matching on their argument. As a result, you are not allowed to use `match ... with` in your code.

1. Define a function `last_element: 'a list -> 'a` that returns the last element of a list. Your function may return `(invalid_arg "last_element")` when the list is empty.

2. Write a function `is_sorted: 'a list -> bool` that takes a list `l` as argument, and that checks that the list is sorted in increasing order according to the polymorphic comparison operator `<`.

### YOUR OCAML ENVIRONMENT
```ocaml
let rec last_element = function _ ->
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let rec is_sorted = function _ ->
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;
```
