# SIMPLE FUNCTIONS OVER INTEGERS  (20 points possible)
Let's define two functions working with integers:

1. `multiple_of` that takes two integer parameters, `n` and `d`, and determines whether `n` is a multiple of `d`. The function must return a boolean value. This function can be written without recursion. Look at the operators defined on integers in sequence 1.
2. `integer_square_root` that calculates the integer square root of a positive integer `n`, that is the largest integer `r` such that `r * r <= n`. **Hint**: you may use floating point arithmetic, but don't forget that you have to convert explicitely between `float` and `int`.

### YOUR OCAML ENVIRONMENT
```ocaml
let multiple_of n d =
  "Replace this string by your implementation." ;;

let integer_square_root n =
  "Replace this string by your implementation." ;;
```
