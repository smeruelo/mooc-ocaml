# MULTISET  (25 points possible)
A multiset is like a set, with the difference that a value can appear more than once.

1. Implement a module `MultiSet` that implements the signature `MultiSet_S`.
2. Define a function `letters: string -> char MultiSet.t` (where `MultiSet` is the module defined in the previous question). This function produces a multiset in which all characters are associated to the times they appear in the input string.
3. Define a function `anagram: string -> string -> bool` that uses the previous function to tell if two words have the same multiset of characters.

### THE GIVEN PRELUDE
```ocaml
module type MultiSet_S = sig

  (* A multi-set of type ['a t] is a collection of values of
     type ['a] that may occur several times. *)
  type 'a t

  (* [occurrences s x] return the number of time [x] occurs
     in [s]. *)
  val occurrences : 'a t -> 'a -> int

  (* The empty set has no element. There is only one unique
     representation of the empty set. *)
  val empty : 'a t

  (* [insert s x] returns a new multi-set that contains all
     elements of [s] and a new occurrence of [x]. Typically,
     [occurrences s x = occurrences (insert s x) x + 1]. *)
  val insert : 'a t -> 'a -> 'a t

  (* [remove s x] returns a new multi-set that contains all elements
     of [s] minus an occurrence of [x] (if [x] actually occurs in
     [s]). Typically, [occurrences s x = occurrences (remove s x) x -
     1] if [occurrences s x > 0]. *)
  val remove : 'a t -> 'a -> 'a t

end
```

### YOUR OCAML ENVIRONMENT
```ocaml
module MultiSet = struct
  (* Replace this comment with your implementation. *)
end ;;

let letters word =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let anagram word1 word2 =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;
```
