# OPENING MODULES  (45 points possible)

1. The code given in the template has been written using some values declared in three modules of [the standard library](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/stdlib.html). Can you find what are these three modules? When you have found them, just use `open` directives to have the code accepted by the type checker. Be aware that the `iter` function appears in multiple module and that the order in which you `open` the modules is important.

### YOUR OCAML ENVIRONMENT
```ocaml
let print_hashes (hashes : Digest.t list) : unit =
  let print_hash h = h |> to_hex |> uppercase |> print_endline in
  iter print_hash hashes;;
```
