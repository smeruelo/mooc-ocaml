# TYPE ABSTRACTION USING A SIGNATURE  (20 points possible)
Encapsulate the type and values given in the template in a module named `Exp`.

To make `e` abstract, assign a signature to the module `Exp` that makes the type `e` abstract and publish the functions `int`, `mul` and `add`.

Given that interface, the only way to build a value of type `e` is to use the functions `int`, `mul`, `add`, and `to_string`. Such functions are called _smart constructors_ because they perform some smart operations when they build values.

These smart constructors enforce the invariant that an expression represented by a value of type `e` is always simplified, i.e. it does not contain a subexpression of the form `e * 1`, `1 * e`, `e * 0`, `0 * e`, `0 + e` or `e + 0`.

* The following expression should be accepted.
```ocaml
Exp.mul (Exp.int 0) (Exp.add (Exp.int 1) (Exp.int 2))
```

* The following expression should be rejected.
```ocaml
Exp.EMul (Exp.EInt 0) (Exp.EAdd (Exp.EInt 1) (Exp.EInt 2))
```

Unfortunately, turning `e` into an abstract data type prevents the user from pattern matching over values of type `e`. To allow pattern matching while forbidding the direct application of data constructors, OCaml provides a mechanism called `private types`. The interested student can get more information about this advanced (off-topic) feature [here](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-400/manual021.html#toc76).

### YOUR OCAML ENVIRONMENT
```ocaml
type e = EInt of int | EMul of e * e | EAdd of e * e

let int x = EInt x

let mul a b =
  match a, b with
  | EInt 0, _ | _, EInt 0 -> EInt 0
  | EInt 1, e | e, EInt 1 -> e
  | a, b -> EMul (a, b)

let add a b =
  match a, b with
  | EInt 0, e | e, EInt 0 -> e
  | a, b -> EAdd (a, b)

let rec to_string = function
  | EInt i -> string_of_int i
  | EMul (l, r) -> "(" ^ to_string l ^ " * " ^ to_string r ^ ")"
  | EAdd (l, r) -> "(" ^ to_string l ^ " + " ^ to_string r ^ ")"
```
