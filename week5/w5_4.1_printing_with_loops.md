# PRINTING WITH LOOPS  (105 points possible)

1. Using the `for` loop construct, write an `output_multiples : int -> int -> int -> unit` function that prints all the multiples of `x` in the integer interval `n ... m`, separated by commas (`','`).

2. Define a higher order function `display_sign_until_zero: (int -> int) -> int -> unit` that takes a function `f`, an integer `m` and applies `f` from `0` to `m` using a `for` loop. The function will print `"negative"` if the result of f if strictly negative and `"positive"` if strictly positive. Each print should appear on a new line.
Your function has to stop displaying the signs as soon as `f` returns `0`. In this case, it must print a last `"zero"`.
To implement this, you will define your own exception, `raise` it from inside the loop to break it, and catch it outside of the loop so that the function returns a successful `()`. You cannot use a predefined exception.

### THE GIVEN PRELUDE
```
let is_multiple i x = i mod x = 0
```

### YOUR OCAML ENVIRONMENT
```
let output_multiples x n m =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let display_sign_until_zero f m =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;
```
