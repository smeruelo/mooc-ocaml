# DISPLAYING A FILESYSTEM HIERARCHY  (320 points possible)
In this exercise, we will pretty-print directory structures.

The prelude gives the types that we will use to represent directory structures. A `node` in the filesystem is either a simple `File`, a `Directory` that contains a nested filesystem, or a `Symlink`.
The latter, as on Unix systems, is a fake file that redirects to another file. For this, it provides the relative path to this target file. The path is the list of directory to traverse to get to the target file, followed by the later. If one has to go a directory up, we use the common `".."` directory name that represents the parent directory.
A filesystem is a list of named nodes. An example filesystem is given below, in the format that you will have to produce. Don't worry, we'll break this piece by piece.

```
  /photos
  | /march
  | | photo_1.bmp
  | | photo_2.bmp
  | | photo_3.bmp
  | | index.html
  | /april
  | | photo_1.bmp
  | | photo_2.bmp
  | | index.html
  /videos
  | video1.avi
  | video2.avi
  | video3.avi
  | video4.avi
  | best.avi -> video4.avi
  | index.html
  /indexes
  | videos.html -> ../videos/index.html
  | photos_march.html -> ../photos/march/index.html
  | photos_april.html -> ../photos/april/index.html
  | photos_may.html -> INVALID
```
This output was generated from the following OCaml structure.

```
[ "photos", Dir
    [ "march", Dir
        [ "photo_1.bmp", File ;
          "photo_2.bmp", File ;
          "photo_3.bmp", File ;
          "index.html", File ] ;
      "april", Dir
        [ "photo_1.bmp", File ;
          "photo_2.bmp", File ;
          "index.html", File ] ] ;
  "videos", Dir
    [ "video1.avi", File ;
      "video2.avi", File ;
      "video3.avi", File ;
      "video4.avi", File ;
      "best.avi", Symlink [ "video4.avi" ] ;
      "index.html", File ] ;
  "indexes", Dir
    [ "videos.html",
      Symlink [ ".." ; "videos" ; "index.html" ] ;
      "photos_march.html",
      Symlink [ ".." ; "photos" ; "march" ; "index.html" ] ;
      "photos_april.html",
      Symlink [ ".." ; "photos" ; "april" ; "index.html" ] ;
      "photos_may.html",
      Symlink [ ".." ; "photos" ; "may" ; "index.html" ] ] ]
```

1. Write a function `print_path: string list -> unit` that prints a relative path (the argument of a `Symlink`) and pretty prints it as shown in the example display, using slashes (`'/'`) as separator.
As you can see in the example, the depth of a file in the filesystem (the number of nested folders that are its ancestors) is represented by a sequence of vertical lines. Write a function `print_file: int -> string -> unit` that prints a file name, with the given number of `"| "` in front of it.

2. Write a similar function `print_symlink: int -> string -> string list -> unit` that prints the link name, with the given number of `"| "` in front of it, and the relative path (preceded by an arrow `" -> "`).

3. Write a similar function `print_dir: int -> string -> unit` that prints the dir name, with the given number of `"| "` in front of it, and the prepended `'/'`.

4. Write a function `print_filesystem: filesystem -> unit` that traverses the filesystem, producing the same display as in the example. You will probably need an auxiliary, recursive function, and you will have to use the previous answers.

5. Write a function `resolve: string list -> string list -> string list`. It takes as parameters:
  * The full path from the root to a symlink, including its name. In the given example, that could be for instance `[ "indexes" ; "photos_april.html" ]`.
  * The relative path for this symlink. Here, that would be `[ ".." ; "photos" ; "april" ; "index.html" ]`.

The function returns the full path from the root to the target of the symlink. Here, we should get `[ "photos" ; "april" ; "index.html" ]`. Note that it may not be as easy as it seems, so you may think about it before plunging into the code.

6. Write a function `file_exists : filesystem -> string list -> bool` that tells if a file exists in the filesystem. The path is the full absolute path to the file, and the target must be a `File`, not a `Dir` or a `Symlink`.
Update your function `print_filesystem: filesystem -> unit` so that it replaces the printed relative path by `"INVALID"` when the symlink cannot be resolved to an existing file.
