# AN IMPLEMENTATION OF LIST WITH AN EFFICIENT CONCATENATION  (56 points possible)
Concatenating two standard OCaml lists takes a time proportional to the length of the first list. In this exercise, we implement a data structure for lists with a constant time concatenation.
The preludes gives a type `'a clist`, which is either a single element of type `'a`, the concatenation of two `'a clist` or an empty `'a clist`.
This representation of a list is not linear: it is a tree-like datastructure since the CApp constructor contains two values of type `'a clist`.
The sequence of elements contained in a value of type `'a clist` is obtained by a depth-first traversal of the tree. For instance, the example given in the prelude, of type `int clist` is a valid representation for the sequence `[1;2;3;4]`.

1. Write a function `to_list : 'a clist -> 'a list` which computes the `'a list` that contains the same elements as the input `'a clist`, in the same order.

2. Write a function `of_list : 'a list -> 'a clist` which computes the `'a clist` that contains the same elements as the input `'a list`, in the same order.

3. Write a function `append : 'a clist -> 'a clist -> 'a clist` such that:
    * `append CEmpty l = append l CEmpty = l`
    * `append l1 l2 = CApp (l1, l2)` otherwise

4. Write a function `hd : 'a clist -> 'a option` that returns `Some x` where `x` is the first element of the input `'a clist`, if it is not empty, and returns `None` otherwise.

5. Write a function `tl : 'a clist -> 'a clist option` that returns `Some l` where `l` is the input sequence without its first element, if this input sequence is not empty, or returns `None` otherwise.

### THE GIVEN PRELUDE
```ocaml
type 'a clist =
  | CSingle of 'a
  | CApp of 'a clist * 'a clist
  | CEmpty

let example =
  CApp (CApp (CSingle 1,
              CSingle 2),
        CApp (CSingle 3,
              CApp (CSingle 4, CEmpty)))
```

### YOUR OCAML ENVIRONMENT
```ocaml
let to_list l =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let rec of_list l =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let append l1 l2 =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let hd l =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let tl l =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;
```
