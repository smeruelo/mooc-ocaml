# FIRST IN FIRST OUT  (50 points possible)
A queue is a standard FIFO data structure. See wikipedia

In this exercise, we implement a queue with a pair of two lists `(front, back)` such that `front @ List.rev back` represents the sequence of elements in the queue.

1. Write a function `is_empty : queue -> bool` such that `is_empty q` is true if and only if `q` has no element.

2. Write a function `enqueue : int -> queue -> queue` such that `enqueue x q` is the queue as `q` except that `x` is at the end of the queue.

3. Write a function `split : int list -> int list * int list` such that `split l = (front, back)` where `l = back @ List.rev front` and the length of `back` and `front` is `List.length l / 2` or `List.length l / 2 + 1`

4. Write a function `dequeue : queue -> int * queue` such that `dequeue q = (x, q')` where `x `is the front element of the queue `q` and `q'` corresponds to remaining elements. This function assumes that `q` is non empty.

### THE GIVEN PRELUDE
```ocaml
type queue = int list * int list
```

### YOUR OCAML ENVIRONMENT
```ocaml
let is_empty (front, back) =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let enqueue x (front, back) =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let split l =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let dequeue (front, back) =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;
```
