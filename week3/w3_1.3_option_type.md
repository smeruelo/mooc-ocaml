# THE OPTION TYPE  (30 points possible)
Optional values are commonly used in OCaml in the return type of partial functions, i.e. functions that may fail on some input. The following questions illustrate such situations.
In the `Pervasives` module which is loaded automatically, there is a type `option` with two constructors:
* `Some (e)` has type `'t option` if e has type `'t` and represents the presence of some value `e` of type `'t`
* `None` has type `'t option` and represents the absence of some value of type `'t`

1. Write a function `find : string array -> string -> int option such that find a w = Some idx if a.(idx) = w and find a w = None if there is no such index.

2. Sometimes, when a value of type t is missing, a default value should be used.
Write a function default_int : int option -> int such that: default_int None = 0 and default_int (Some x) = x.

3. Write a function `merge : int option -> int option -> int option` such that:
    * `merge None None = None`
    * `merge (Some x) None = merge None (Some x) = Some x`
    * `merge (Some x) (Some y) = Some (x + y)`

### YOUR OCAML ENVIRONMENT
```ocaml
let find a w =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let default_int =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let merge a b =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;
```
