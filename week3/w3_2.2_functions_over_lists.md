# CLASSIC FUNCTIONS OVER LISTS  (40 points possible)
In this exercise, we implement the classic functions over lists.

1. Write a function `mem : int -> int list -> bool` such that `mem x l` is true if and only if `x` occurs in `l`.

2. Write a function `append : int list -> int list -> int list` such that `append l1 l2` is the concatenation of `l1` and `l2`.

3. Write a function `combine : int list -> int list -> (int * int) list` such that `combine l1 l2` is the list of pairs obtained by joining the elements of `l1 and l2`. This function assumes that `l1` and `l2` have the same length. For instance, `combine [1;2] [3;4] = [(1, 3); (2, 4)]`.

4. Write a function `assoc : (string * int) list -> string -> int option` such that `assoc l k = Some x if (k, x)` is the first pair of `l` whose first component is `k`. If no such pair exists, `assoc l k = None`.

### YOUR OCAML ENVIRONMENT
```ocaml
let rec mem x l =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let rec append l1 l2 =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let rec combine l1 l2 =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let rec assoc l k =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;
```
