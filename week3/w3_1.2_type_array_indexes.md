# A TYPE FOR ARRAY INDEXES  (40 points possible)
The previous week, we asked you the following question: Consider a non empty array of integers `a`, write a function `min_index : int array -> int` that returns the index of the minimal element of `a`.
As the arrays contain integers and the indices of arrays are also represented by integers, you might have confused an index and the content of a cell. To avoid such a confusion, let us define a type for index (given in the prelude below).
This type has a single constructor waiting for one integer.
For instance, if you want to represent the index 0, use the value `Index 0`.
Defining such a type is interesting because it allows the type-checker to check that an integer is not used where an index is expected (or the converse).

1. Write a function `read : int array -> index -> int` such that `read a (Index k)` returns the k-th element of `a`.

2. Write a function `inside : int array -> index -> bool` such that `inside a idx` is true if and only if `idx` is a valid index for the array `a`.

3. Write a function `next : index -> index` such that `next (Index k)` is equal to `Index (k + 1)`.

4. Consider a non empty array of integers `a`, write a function `min_index : int array -> index` that returns the index of the minimal element of `a`.

### THE GIVEN PRELUDE
```ocaml
type index = Index of int
```

### YOUR OCAML ENVIRONMENT
```ocaml
let read a index =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let inside a index =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let next index =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let min_index a =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;
```
