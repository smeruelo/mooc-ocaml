# BALANCED BINARY TREES  (22 points possible)
A binary tree `t`, of the `'a bt` type given in the prelude, is either an empty tree, or the root of a tree with a value and two children subtrees.

1. Write a function `height : 'a bt -> int` that computes the height of a tree.

2. A tree is balanced if, for all internal node `n`, its two subtrees have the same height. Write a function `balanced : 'a bt -> bool` that tells if a tree is balanced.

### THE GIVEN PRELUDE
```ocaml
type 'a bt =
  | Empty
  | Node of 'a bt * 'a * 'a bt ;;
```

### YOUR OCAML ENVIRONMENT
```ocaml
let rec height t =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;

let rec balanced t =
  "Replace this string with your implementation." ;;
```
